=== Volga Tools ===
Miscellaneous utilities that will be deployed to `/usr/local/bin` on volga hosts. 

One-off scripts that aren't a part of regular production processing should go here. Anything that's a part of production processes or any tool that isn't self-contained in a single file likely deserves it's own folder (see: volga-etl, ods_archiving, etc).
